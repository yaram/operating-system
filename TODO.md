## Complete



## In progress



## Not started / ideas

- multiprocessing
- better error handling (cascade out-of-memory errors up call stack, maybe no useless "thing here" error messages)
- processes subscribe to hardware interrupts
- \[user\] test keyboard input with USB keyboard maybe
- \[user\] test ahci/sata disk access/loading
- ELF executable validation
- process-loading syscall, user-space program provides program to load in in-memory buffer
- dynamic object file loading
- relocatable-type ELF files for everything
- release a toolchain (just llvm or do we need binutils?)
- \[user\] first-party/reference/example std library / hardware abstraction library
- custom object/binary format with custom 'linker'
- memory page execution/read/write protection for user pages
